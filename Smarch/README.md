# Smarch
Smarch is a tool to Uniformly Random Sample (URS) solutions of a propositional formula. For a given dimacs file, Smarch will count the number of solutions, generate a random number from 1 to number of solutions, and create a one-to-one mapping between a random number and a configuraiton.

## Prerequisites
Smarch relies on following tools:
* sharpSAT (https://sites.google.com/site/marcthurley/sharpsat): A exact model counting tool. To build, run make inside Release folder.
* march_cu (https://github.com/marijnheule/march-SAT-solver): Solver based on cube-and-conquer algorithm. To build, run make inside folder.

Source files for both tools are included in the repository.
You can build each tool by running make.

Smarch python script uses following additional packages: anytree, pycosat

## How to run
```python
python3 smarch.py -c <constfile> -o <outputdir> -l -k <dimacsfile> <samplecount>
```
* dimacsfile: Location of the dimacs file.
* samplecount: Number of samples to create.
* constfile: Location of the constraint file. (default: none)
* outputdir: Directory to create the output files. (default: (dimacs location)/smarch) 
* -l: Create a log json file for the tree structure (evaluation purpose only)
* -k: Create .config files from samples (requires dimacs formula from Kclause)

## Output
On the specified outputdir, samples.txt file lists the samples.
Each line represents a sample, which is a list of variables.
Positive value means true is assigned, negative value means false is assigned.
